/*

Think of 5 different real world "things" that you 
can describe with a JavaScript object

Assign each of them to a separate variable


For example:
var car = {
    brand: "Seat",
    model: "Arona",
    color: "white",
    horsepower: 115,
    doors: 5
};

const objects = [
myDog = {
    breed: "border collie",
    color: "black and white",
    height: "90cm",
    weight: "30kg"
}, 
 table = {
    color: "blue", 
    legs: "4", 
    height: "1 meter"
}
]

console.log(objects)
